These are my reflections. What do you think??


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Cons: You might forget to commit.
Pros: You have more control.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

For coding, a single new feature or change often has to be carried out across multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log gives you an overview of all the commits.
Git diff allows you to look at the exact differences between two commits.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You would not worry about breaking your code permanently. You could make lots of different sorts of changes and experiment more.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For making xcode apps.
