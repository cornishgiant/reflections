What happens when you initialize a repository? 
A git directory is created that records and tracks the changes in your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds the files that you want to commit to the repository. It allows you to commit multiple changes across multiple files in one go.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?


You can use it to compare differeces in the files to those in the working directory and commits.
